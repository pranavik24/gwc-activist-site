# gwc-activist-site
This is my activist site. I developed this site as a mini-project for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in July 2022. 

## Objective
I wanted to create a site that would bring awareness to the issue of girl's education around the world.
The goal of this project was to become more comfortable with web design. In this project, I honed my skills with site design and client-side scripting using DOM.
