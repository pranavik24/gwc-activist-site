# gwc-activist-site
This is my activist site. I developed this site for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in July 2022. 

## Objective
I wanted to create a site that would bring awareness to the issue of girl's education around the world.
My goal is for all women across the world to have the ability to further their learning. 

## Challenges
While creating the website, I was having a trouble debugging the javascript. It was definately challenging using DOM, but I am proud of the end result.
